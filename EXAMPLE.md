# Partial Result Example

## Why partial ? 
Since the content is too long, we can't show the full content in the main page. So, we can show a part of the content and the user can click on the panel to see the full content.
As well as the content includes java script code. 
It is being displayed as a panels, each panel include a title, by clicking on the panel the content will be displayed.

## Example

<div class="panel" onclick="togglePanelContent(this)">
            <div class="panel-title">Amazon EMR 7.1 now supports additional metrics for enhanced monitoring</div>
            <div class="panel-content">
